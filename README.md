# Vision-based control system for car entrance gate
 The engineering project involved constructing a video system to control an entrance gate. The image from an IP camera mounted above the gate was read via RTSP protocol. One of two license plate recognition algorithms then processed the image to extract the license plate number and compared it to the plates stored in the database. The first algorithm implemented classic computer vision techniques using the resources of the OpenCV library. The second algorithm was based on the use of a deep YOLO neural network to recognize the car, license plate and alphanumeric characters from the plate sequentially. In the final stage of operation, the system sent the car recognition signal to an ESP32 microcontroller connected to the gate control module, allowing the gate to be opened.
